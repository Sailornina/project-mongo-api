# Project Mongo API

This is my second API project, documented via Swagger. I learned to "translate" Express queries from a previous project to Mongoose. The dataset consists of the World Cup (1930 - 2018).
## Challenges

The most difficult part about this project was the deployment. Connecting Google Cloud and Mongo Compass with MongoDB Cloud Atlas took a while to figure out.
